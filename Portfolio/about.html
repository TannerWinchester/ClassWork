      <h1>Where it began</h1>
      <p>My interest in the coding field came from my love for all things tech. I find it extremely fascinating to keep up with
        new technologies that are presented to the public and to see the rate at which they improve and revolutionize our every day
        lives. Having a nack for all things tech and a extensive gaming background when you put those two things together it would seem
        the only outcome I could see myself having as an occupation is something that I genuinlly enjoy being a part of. 
      </p>
      <h1>Goals for the future</h1>
      <p>I plan on learning many different languages to have a solid background in the coding world, Once I complete my education I will work to
        become a full stack developer. I love learning new things, with dedication and excellent work ethic I know that anything
        is possible when I put my mind to the task.
      </p>
      <h1>My interests and hobbies</h1>
      <p>I consider myself an outdoorsmen, I always make an effort to get out and do some hunting when season comes around. During the winter
        I snowboard as much as I can and when the warmer months come around I find my peace hiking in the hills. My home life consists of
        gaming with my friends and binge watching movies.
