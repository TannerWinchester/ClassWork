#Modification log:   


    1/26 - Added in contact newsletter and email form with out JS to get a head start.


    1/27 - Removed contact, newsletter and email form to redo completely as it didnt work with JS.
            Added in JS for newsletter and email forms and redesigned the page layout.
            Added in FAQ and JS for the requirements.
           ****Realized the the $ function was conflicting with the little jquery for the hero class and thats why ill have to either redo the hero class or use '$function' to workaround that conflict within the JS file.****

    1/28 - added contact page, made edits to the qoutes section, darkened table, added more FAQs 
           and made all H1 tags bigger. 


    1/29 - Tried to fix error in JS for the Contact section, although the console showed no errors
           I could not get the code to function properly, it would not grab the value of the text 
           area for the user input. I commented it out so the rest of the file would work properly.
           Made sure everything else was up to par and met the requirements.
